You can use Ball, Beam, and Shield with your element. 
Note: Effects such as freezing, burning, extra damage or slipping have a 15% chance of occurring with any attack, and 75% of occurring when in contact with a pool and 95% of occurring when using Strike.

passive extra-abilities

Ball (Activated) <Element>
offensive damaging pushing projectile cooldown cost
Create a ball of <e> and throw it with force towards a target.
Deals normal damage with an extra 1 pushback. 
Costs ….some amount per second. 5 / attackRate * 1.5.


Beam (Maintained) <Element>
offensive damaging pushing beam continuous-cost
Shoot a continuous beam of <e>.
Deals the same amount of damage but continuously (every 0.2 seconds, damage is damage*attackRate*0.04), instead of every X seconds. Hits immediately.
Costs ….some amount per second. 5 / attackRate * 1.5.
NOTE:  Plant-Beams are completely different. Vines are shot, like an infinitely increasing line, until the person can't shoot anymore (lack of \mana) and they are destroyed, or when they latch onto a person. If the vine reaches its full range, it will retract.
When vines hit an enemy with their end they're "grabbling" it. While grabbling an enemy, there is a fixed-length vine stretching between the vine creator and the grabbled person.
Grabbled enemies are damaged by the vine at 0.5*points damage every 0.5 seconds. The vine now acts as a one-sided spring: When one of the people tries to move away from the vine, it stretches and draws them back, more strongly the more it stretches. The creator of the vine has increased control over the vine - they functionally have double the mass, in regards to pulling it. They are also able to move the vine sideways, virtually rotating the grabbled enemy around them (more easily the closer they are).
When a vine is dealt enough damage or the creator stops using it, it drops to the floor.
